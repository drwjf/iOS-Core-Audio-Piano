iOS Piano
========

This is a piano application for iOS that uses Core Audio to play audio generated by [The Synthesis ToolKit](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/).

It is an 88 key piano, 52 white and 36 black, but could be easily modified to hold a dynamic number of keys.

Currently the piano view loads inside of a UIScrollview thats content offset is controlled by a UISlider. When a piano key is played, a delegate method is called that provides the key number. A function is then called in the instrument controller to play the current instrument at the frequency of the selected key.
